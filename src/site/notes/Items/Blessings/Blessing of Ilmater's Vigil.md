*Corvit's Blessing*

Blessing from [[Ilmater\|Ilmater]] thus it is null if the recipient leaves the upper planes and material plane.

**Effect**: As a passive blessing, the player gains advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to detect whether a creature has been raised or is an undead. Additionally, once per long rest, the player can cast **Protection from Evil and Good** on themselves without expending a spell slot. This protection shields them from the undead or fiends.
