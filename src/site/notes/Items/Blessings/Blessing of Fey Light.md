*Felix's Blessing*

Blessing from [[Ilmater\|Ilmater]] thus it is null if the recipient leaves the upper planes and material plane.

**Effect:** 3 times per day, when the druid casts any healing spell, it is infused with [[Ilmater\|Ilmater]]â€™s divine compassion, adding radiant energy to the healing. The healing spell restores an additional 1d4 hit points. This radiant healing can also extend to creatures that would normally be resistant to healing magic (such as undead).
